## Objective
The objective of this project is to build a robot that assists in sorting pills for those: 
* with a busy schedule 
* any individual that may be color blind 
* anyone who may have difficulties sorting pills 
* for anyone that just likes robots or Legos in general 
The outcome of this color sorting technique will be visible in a mini pill organizer. 

## Part's List
* Legos and Lego tape
* Colored M&Mâ€™s and Tic Tac
* Raspberry Pi
* Webcam
* Servos
* Battery Pack

## Software Used
* Python
* OpenCV
* Raspian

## Techniques Used
* Pills are fed through the ramp and spotted by the webcam before they go to their designated areas.
* OpenCV Color Detection technique was used to program the Logitech webcam to see which pill is required. 
* The servo at the bottom of the ramp waits for the instructions from the webcam and OpenCV code.
* Once the specific pill is seen, the servo moves it to the right bin.
